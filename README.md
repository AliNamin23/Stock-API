# Stock-API

As stocks are growing in popularity within the college community, extracting and analyzing information about specific stocks 
can often be tedious. While large sites contain a lot of information about stocks, often times the information that the user 
is seeking is difficult to navigate to and multiple clicks away.  Our program will allow us to enable users to view 
statistical information and active fluctuations of their favorite stocks through the use of imported lists and files with 
accurate information from Yahoo Finance, ensuring that users are kept up to date on a regular basis.
